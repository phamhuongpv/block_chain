# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
#terminal 1
npx hardhat node
 
#terminal 2
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```
